# Dora the Explorer

As the name suggests everything, it is a simple package to find the best route to cover all the places (at max 4 for now) which was pre-planned and helps by displaying the best route with respect to distance and finally reach the source place i.e., home.

We have known about one of the famous problems in mathematics - graph theory that is Travelling Salesman Problem. To give a simple gist about the problem, basically there is a salesman who has to travel a bunch of places (cities) to deliver the items. There could be some many possibilities to cover all the cities and reach to his/her source place. But it is very important for a salesman to choose best possible route with gives minimal distance. By this he/she can save a lot time and effort and deliver the items at the earliest. For this project, I have considered distance as an important factor later on time factor can be added.
